Welcome to the Acetylcholinesterase Computational Drug Discovery Repository!

This repository contains data and code for using the ChEMBL database to perform computational drug discovery for Acetylcholinesterase.

The dataset used in this project is comprised of compounds that have been biologically tested for their activity towards Acetylcholinesterase. The molecular descriptors of these compounds have been calculated using the PADEL-Descriptor software.

The repository contains the following:

The ChEMBL data in CSV format
The molecular descriptor data in CSV format
Code for training a machine learning model on the ChEMBL data and using it to predict the activity of new compounds.
Additional code and notebooks for data exploration and analysis
To use this repository, you will need to have Python and the following libraries installed: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn.
You will also need to have PADEL-Descriptor software installed.

To begin, simply clone the repository and run the code in the provided Jupyter notebooks. Feel free to use and adapt the code for your own projects, and if you have any questions or issues, please open an issue on the repository.

Thank you for visiting and have fun exploring the data!
